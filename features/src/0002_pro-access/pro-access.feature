Feature: Pro Access

    Only users with an `Pro` subscription must have access
    to the Pro-functions.

    Use Github Sponsors. Github invites users to the `CalliopaDev/CalliopaPro` repository.

    The programming interface to pro features resides within the free CalliopaDev source code.

    Either one:
    - When running calliopa commands that use Pro features, try to access
      the Pro code on in the Pro repository
    - Try to access prop repo post-install hook. Disadvantage: the user must re-install after
      becoming a sponsor
